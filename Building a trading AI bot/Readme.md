## AI Trading bot
### Purpose
- In this project I wanted to create an AI trading bot that is ssensitive to real time events and news and allo us to interpret news events for us to make buy or sell orders in our tarades

I broke down this project into 3 stages:
#### Data collection and Analysis
- Here I used langchain to load data from our web pages such as Bloomberg,Forbes in order to collect data that may affect our currency pairs

#### Risk Management
- I created a logic part of the bot such that it executes our buy or sell orders depending on the users risk appetite. I have places a stop loss of 10 pips and trading profit of 20 pips in our bot

#### Trade execution
- Our bot will be able to automatically inteprete news from our desired data source and execute buy or sell orders.
