# Chronic Diseases Analysis

This repository contains code and resources for analyzing the distribution of chronic diseases in US states over a certain period. The project aims to understand the prevalence and distribution of chronic diseases, explore stratification processes used to group patients, and analyze how each state is affected by different diseases or topics.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains information on chronic diseases collected from various sources. It includes columns such as YearStart, YearEnd, LocationAbbr, LocationDesc, DataSource, Topic, Question, DataValueType, StratificationCategory1, Stratification1, LocationID, TopicID, QuestionID, DataValueTypeID, StratificationCategoryID1, and StratificationID1.

## Project Overview

The analysis focuses on the following objectives:

1. **Exploring Chronic Disease Distribution**: Analyzing the distribution of chronic diseases across different states in the US.
2. **Investigating Stratification Processes**: Examining the stratification process used to group patients based on demographic factors such as gender, race/ethnicity, and age.
3. **Analyzing State-level Impact**: Assessing how each state is affected by different chronic diseases or topics.
4. **Usefulness in Research Studies**: Evaluating the usefulness of the analysis in informing research studies related to chronic diseases and public health interventions.
